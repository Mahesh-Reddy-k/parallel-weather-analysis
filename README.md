## Problem Statement  
Climate and weather data are growing rapidly in both size and complexity, coming from satellites, sensors, and climate models.  
Analyzing these datasets using traditional sequential methods is slow and inefficient.  
Real-time or near-real-time insights into patterns such as temperature anomalies, precipitation extremes, or wind speed variations are critical for applications in agriculture, disaster management, and climate research.  

This project builds a **parallelized, cloud-compatible system** that:  
1. Efficiently ingests and preprocesses large-scale weather datasets (e.g., BharatBench NetCDF files).  
2. Performs parallelized computations (e.g., monthly averages, anomalies, and spatio-temporal trends) using **Dask + Xarray**.  
3. Provides interactive **visualizations** of weather patterns.  
4. Supports deployment on **cloud/HPC environments** for scalability.  

The final deliverable is an **end-to-end pipeline** that demonstrates both local parallelism and cloud-readiness for weather data analytics.

## Step-by-Step Procedure  

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Preprocessing (Weeks 1–2)  
- **Dataset:** BharatBench climate/weather dataset (NetCDF format).  
- **Tools:** Xarray for structured loading, Dask for parallel processing.  
- **Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize units (°C, mm, m/s).  
- **Storage:** Organize raw vs. processed data in a reproducible folder structure.  

### Phase 2: Parallelized Data Analysis (Weeks 3–4)  
- Load data into Dask-backed Xarray objects.  
- Compute monthly/seasonal averages in parallel.  
- Calculate **climate anomalies** (current vs. baseline averages).  
- Perform spatio-temporal trend analysis (linear regression over time).  

### Phase 3: Visualization & Exploration (Weeks 5–6)  
- Visualize temperature/precipitation/wind maps (matplotlib, cartopy).  
- Build interactive dashboards (Plotly/Streamlit).  
- Generate time-series plots of anomalies and seasonal cycles.  
- Export results as figures/JSON for reporting.  

### Phase 4: Cloud Integration (Weeks 7–8)  
- Run batch computations on distributed clusters (Dask on HPC / cloud).  
- Store processed outputs in cloud storage (e.g., AWS S3 / Azure Blob).  
- Develop API endpoints (FastAPI/Flask) for querying results.  
- Demonstrate scalability (performance comparison: single-core vs. multi-core vs. cluster).  

### Phase 5: Testing & Final Deliverables (Week 9)  
- Validate results against known baselines.  
- Benchmark performance improvements (execution time, memory usage).  
- Build a simple web dashboard for demonstration.  
- Prepare final report, pipeline diagram, and README with usage guide.

## Deliverables  
- Preprocessed dataset with standardized formats.  
- Parallelized anomaly/trend detection modules.  
- Visualization outputs (maps, time-series).  
- Cloud-ready pipeline with performance benchmarks.  
- Final report + dashboard/web demo.
