# Parallel Weather Data Analysis and Visualization System
## Description
This project is focused on high-performance and cloud computing techniques to analyze and visualize large-scale weather datasets (BharatBench/IMDAA datasets). It enables users to process climate and weather data in parallel, extract meaningful insights such as trends, anomalies, and variability, and generate interactive visualizations for scientific and research purposes.

# Features

Parallel processing of large .nc (NetCDF) climate datasets using Dask + Xarray

Regional and temporal climate analysis (temperature, precipitation, wind, etc.)

Computation of climatologies and anomalies

Efficient data aggregation and statistical summaries

Interactive visualizations using Matplotlib/Plotly

Scalable execution on both local and cloud platforms (HPC or cloud clusters)
